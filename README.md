    * Python (version recommended: [insert recommended version])
    * NumPy ([https://numpy.org/](https://numpy.org/))
    * Pandas ([https://pandas.pydata.org/](https://pandas.pydata.org/))
    * Matplotlib ([https://matplotlib.org/](https://matplotlib.org/))
    * Seaborn ([https://seaborn.pydata.org/](https://seaborn.pydata.org/))
    * Scikit-learn ([https://scikit-learn.org/](https://scikit-learn.org/))
    * TensorFlow ([https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://www.tensorflow.org/)) or Keras ([https://keras.io/](https://keras.io/))  (choose one)
    * Kivy (optional, for GUI development: [https://kivy.org/](https://kivy.org/))
* **Installation:**
    1. Ensure you have Python and the listed libraries installed. Refer to their respective websites for installation instructions.
    2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://[your_github_repo_url].git`
    3. (Optional) If using a virtual environment, activate it now.
    4. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Predicter`
    5. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (create a requirements.txt file listing the libraries)

### Usage

1. Run the main script: `python main.py` (replace with your main script name)
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system (if applicable). 
* For Kivy-based GUI: The script will launch the graphical user interface.
* For command-line interface: You may be prompted to enter car or house data for prediction.
